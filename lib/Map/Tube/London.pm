=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_shortest_route($from, $to)

It expects C<$from> and C<$to> station name, required param. It returns an object
of type L<Map::Tube::Route>. On error it throws exception of type L<Map::Tube::Exception>.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use Map::Tube::London;

    my $tube  = Map::Tube::London->new;
    my $route = $tube->get_shortest_route('Baker Street', 'Farringdon');

    print "Route: $route\n";;

=head2 as_image($line_name)

It expects the plugin  L<Map::Tube::Plugin::Graph> to be  installed. Returns line
image  as  base64  encoded string if C<$line_name> passed in otherwise it returns
base64 encoded string of the entire map.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use MIME::Base64;
    use Map::Tube::London;

    my $tube = Map::Tube::London->new;
    my $map  = $tube->name;
    open(my $IMAGE, ">", "$map.png");
       or die "ERROR: Can't open [$map.png]: $!";
    binmode($IMAGE);
    print $IMAGE decode_base64($tube->as_image);
    close($IMAGE);
